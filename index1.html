            My name is Megan Lockette. I'm 26 years old and I'm from Oakland, California. Growing up, I wanted to be
            every
            profession you could possibly think of, from a school teacher to a Victoria Secret Angel, just to walk down
            the
            runway in huge and extravgant angel wings. In 2011, straight out of my senior year of high school, I went to
            San
            Jose State University and majored in Business Management. I had my heart set on being a fashion buyer.
            Traveling
            and shopping sounded like a dream job to me! Well into my third year, I failed my first class ever!!! It was
            calculus for "business and avaiation students". I remember thinking, "Why am I even in the same math class
            as
            aviation students?" I thought long and hard and began reflecting back on the courses I took outside of my
            major
            that I really enjoyed. The one that stood out the most was Sociology 101. I knew then I had to drop my
            current
            major and take the necessary steps to switch to Sociology.

            My mom has always been a role model to me, so when she suggested for the thousandth time, "Why don't you
            learn
            how to code?", I listened. At this point in my life, I was realizing just how much my current career was
            taking
            a toll on my mental health and everyday mood. Spending majority of my days with previously homeless families
            and
            individuals, counseling them about how to deal with their past traumas and unresolved issues was becoming
            overwhelming. I wanted a job that I could enjoy coming to and when I learned exactly what coding was, I was
            all
            in!
